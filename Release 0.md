# **Introduction**
* In this project, our team will create a Chip8 Emulator that is able to run two self created games (and any other Chip8 games) on any javascript enabled web-browser

* Team Members are:
  * Vikash Reddy
  * Kei Nakano
  * Jake Kim
  * Sidharth Miglani
  * Pouya Jamali

# **Project Organization**
## Communication and Meeting Times

* Communication between team members is done via **Slack** and **Whatsapp**

## Software Repository
* The team will be using **Github** to implement code and merge each part together

## Team Software Process
* Our team has decided to follow the **Incremental Development Style**. We have chosen this since we can make changes to our design and software more eaisly with each release. (expand)
	
## Team Roles
The Team is divided into roles as follows:
*   Project Lead - **Kei Nakano** 
*   Submission Handler - **Vikash Reddy**
*   Scrum Master - **Jake Kim**

# **Risk Analysis**
* For this group project, our main concern is if a Team Member decides to drop the course or an unexpected event happens that causes a team member to leave the group. This can cause drastic changes in our scheduling and project division. To combat this, the work will be divided among the rest of the team members.

# **Programming Language**
* This Chip8 Emulator will be coded using **HTML**/**CSS**,**JavaScript**

# **Hardware and Software Requirements**
## Hardware Needed
*   Any computer able to run a modern web browser
