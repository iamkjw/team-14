# **Introduction**
* In this project, our team will create a Chip8 Emulator that is able to run two self created games (and any other Chip8 games) on any javascript enabled web-browser

* Team Members are:
  * Vikash Reddy
  * Kei Nakano
  * Jake Kim
  * Sidharth Miglani
  * Pouya Jamali

# **Project Organization**
## Communication and Meeting Times
* The team will have weekly meetings every **Monday** at **12:30pm** that are flexible with a minimum time of 1 hour. If **additional meeting** times are needed it will be held on **Wednesday** and **Fridays** starting at **12:30** for unexpected circumstances or quick updates

* Communication between team members is done via **Slack** and **Whatsapp**

## Software Repository
* The team will be using **GitHub** to implement code and merge each part together

## Team Software Process
* Our team has decided to follow the **Incremental Development Style**. We have chosen this since we can make changes to our design and software more easily with each release.
	
## Team Roles
The Team is divided into roles as follows:
*   Project Lead - **Kei Nakano** 
*   Submission Handler - **Vikash Reddy**
*   Scrum Master - **Jake Kim**
*   Developer Lead - **Sidharth Miglani**
*   Test Lead - **Pouya Jamali**    
(These roles are subject to change in future if needed)
		
		
# **Risk Analysis**
* For this group project, our main concern is if a Team Member decides to drop the course or an unexpected event happens that causes a team member to leave the group. This can cause drastic changes in our scheduling and project division. To combat this, the work will be divided among the rest of the team members.

# **Programming Language**
* This Chip8 Emulator will be coded using **HTML**/**CSS**,**JavaScript**

# **Hardware and Software Requirements**
## Hardware Needed
*   Any computer able to run a modern web browser 
	
## Software Needed
*   Any web-browser that has JavaScript enabled (ie Google Chrome, Firefox etc...)

# **Major Project Deadlines** (Dates have been updated accordingly to current project schedule)
*   ~~_January 18_  Release 0 Presentation Completed~~
*   ~~_January 25_  Chip8 Emulator completed and ready for automated testing~~
*   ~~**_February 4_  Actual finish date of of Emulator due to inexperience with JavaScript** ~~
*   _February 12_  Automated testing ready to be implemented
*   _February 15_  Chip8 Visualizer completed without pause, step forward etc.. capabilities
*   _February 25_ Chip8 Visualizer fully completed with pause step forward etc.. 
*   _February 28_ Start of creation of two games and Extra helpful tools to implement
*   _March 13_    One game and extra tool completed
*   _March 20_    Second game completed
*   _March 29_    Completion of Release 4 presentation
*   _April 8_     Last minute improvements or potential extra features completed
	
# **Testing**
* ~~For automated testing, our team will be looking into using Selenium, Appium or Jest and will decide once more research on these three tools have been completed.~~

*   _If...else statements will be created by a team member for automated testing. We will still be looking into using either Selenium or Jest if time permits us to use one of those two testing tools._
	
# **Project Breakdown**
## Emulator
*   ~~Each member will be contributing to the emulator working on different aspects~~
  * ~~Three members will work on creating and integrating the opcodes.~~
    * ~~10 hours of work-time needed per person~~
  * ~~Two members will work on reading the game files and loading it into the emulators memory~~  
    * ~~10 hours of work-time needed per person~~
* **_Emulator has been completed but is subject to further improvements later_**
	
## Visualizer
* Two members will be working on this once the emulator is completed
   * ~~15~~ _20_ hours of work-time needed per person

## Games
* Two members will simultaneously work on the two games as others work on the Visualizer
   * ~~15~~ _20_ hours of work-time needed per person
	
## Chip8 Tool
* One member will be simultaneously working on implementing a useful tool
   * ~~20~~ _25_ hours of work-time needed per person

* _Work time needed has been updated due to inexperience with Javascript and based off of how long the emulator actually took._

# **Major Features for Next Release** - update to what next release will include, visulizer testing, maybe extra tool
~~## Chip8 Emulator~~
* ~~An emulator will be completed~~
* ~~Can operate Chip8 games others have created.~~
## Chip8 Visulizer
* Visualizer will be completed
* Be able to see Chip8 games being played in any web browser
* _Visulizer fully completed including pause, step foward etc.._
## _Automated Testing_
* _Automated testing using if...else statments_
* _Be able to implement changes and quickly test for funtionality_
